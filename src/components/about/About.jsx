                        <p className='font-Mont  leading-7 tracking-wide'>Around 2024, while in the midst of my third year of college, I found myself at a crossroads. Uncertain of my future path, I knew I wanted to enter the software development field. However, the vast array of technologies and possibilities felt overwhelming. Where should I even begin?
                                <br />
                                After two months of exploration within the IT field, I discovered the tech stack that resonated most with me: the <span className='text-slate-300 '>MERN</span> stack. With a newfound focus, I embarked on my learning journey. I started by tackling the fundamentals of front-end and back-end development. <span className='text-slate-300 '>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js</span> became my companions on the front-end side. For the back-end, I delved into the basics of <span className='text-slate-300'>Express.js,</span> while <span className='text-slate-300'>MongoDB and Node.js</span> provided the foundation for my database knowledge.


                                Coding became my passion. <br />When my fingers weren't flying across the keyboard, you'd find me either pumping iron at the gym or lost in the world of gaming.
